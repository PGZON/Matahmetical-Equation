# Excursion Test

This project calculates results based on the following formula:

## Formula
\[
\text{Result} = \frac{\text{Average}}{\text{Leg Length}} \times 100
\]

## Formula
\[
\text{Result} = \frac{\text{Average}}{\text{Leg Length}} \times 100
\]

### Formula Details

1. **Average Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{n}
   \]

2. **Final Result Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Result} = \left(\frac{\text{Average}}{\text{Leg Length}}\right) \times 100
   \]
   Here, "Leg Length" is a constant value entered by the user, representing a reference length for calculating performance.

## Project Overview

The Excursion Test uses the above formula to compute a value indicating performance in a specific direction. This calculation helps in understanding and analyzing movement efficiency.
